This respository contains code to accompany the paper "Neural networks trained
with SGD learn distributions of increasing complexity"

S. Goldt.

# In a nutshell

In this plot, we show the test accuracy of a ResNet18 evaluated on CIFAR10
during training with SGD on four different training data sets: the standard
CIFAR10 training set (dark blue), and three different ``clones'' of the training
set. The images of the clones were drawn from a Gaussian mixture fitted to
CIFAR10, a mixture of Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) fitted to CIFAR10, and the
[cifar5m](https://github.com/preetum/cifar5m) data set of [Nakkiran et
al.](https://openreview.net/forum?id=guetrIHLFGI). The clones form a hierarchy
of approximations to CIFAR10: while the Gaussian mixture captures only the first
two moments of the inputs of each class correctly, the images in the WGAN and
cifar5m data sets yield increasingly realistic images by capturing higher-order
statistics. The ResNet18 trained on the Gaussian mixture has the same test
accuracy on CIFAR10 as the baseline model, trained directly on CIFAR10, for the
first 50 steps of SGD; the ResNet18 trained on cifar5m has the same error as the
baseline model for about 2000 steps. This result suggests that the network
trained on CIFAR10 discriminates the images using increasingly higher-order
statistics during training.

# Usage

The key programme to train the network on distributions of increasing complexity
is ```dist_inc_comp.py```. Running the programme with the ```--help``` option
yields an overview over the options.

To train a ResNet18 on CIFAR10, simply run
```
python dist_inc_comp.py --model resnet18 --dataset cifar10
```
If instead you would like to train the ResNet18 on a Gaussian mixture, and test
it on CIFAR10 (that's the green line in the plot above), call
```
python dist_inc_comp.py --model resnet18 --dataset cifar10 --clone gp
```
where ```gp``` indicates that the clone to be used for training is the Gaussian 
process. If you would like to train the model on the GAN data set or on cifar5m,
please contact Sebastian directly while we figure out a better way to share the
raw data sets.
